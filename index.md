# 👋 Hi, I'm Dominic

I'm a network engineer with 6 years of experience in software engineering, currently transitioning into technical writing. I build tools, write docs, and explain technical concepts with clarity.

🚀 Whether you're a dev, a sysadmin, or just curious about tech, you'll find something useful here.
